# Config folder

## autohotkey

used for windows machines, which I sometimes still boot for gaming

## awesome

AwesomeWM tile manager (for when using ArchLinux)

## bat

bat - alternative to cat with syntax highlighting etc..

## doom

Doom Emacs. I mostly only use this for org-roam mode, which is my main
note-taking device

## git

Git settings

## hammerspoon

Hammerspoon - MacOS automation. Mostly use this for toggling windows in/out via
keyboard shortcuts

## idea

IntelliJ etc..

## jj

alternative to git. Needs some custom settings for the prompts to work in zsh

## kak

Kakoune. I don't really use this, but was playing around with it.

## kitty

Kitty terminal - fonts, zoom, a few shortcuts

## LazyVim

LazyVim neovim distro. This is what I use by default now.

## nvim

Personal kickstarted neovim distro. I haven't used this in a while so should
probably delete it.

## tmux

tmux config beyond the default. I don't really use tmux
(kitty does most of what tmux does but better) but occasionally
the session management is useful on remote machines and this is the
config I use when I do that.

## vscode

Haven't really used VS code in a long time but this was one of the first
pieces of config I tracked here.

## wezterm

kitty doesn't exist on windows so wezterm has been trialed there. Haven't gotten
pickers working as nice as Kitty but otherwise seems really good

## zsh

Setup default shell with powerlevel10k better prompt + various plugins.
Using antigen as a package manager currently

(Was on oh-my-zsh for the longest time, but doesn't support
plugging packages easily and wanted zsh-async. I tried zplug
but it seemed buggy and slow)
